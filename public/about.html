<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
	I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in December 2022, achieving a
	GPA of 3.45. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in
	web development and a passion for technology. I find challenges fun and am
	always eager to learn new things, which drives my continuous improvement and
	innovation in the field. I look forward to exploring opportunities where I can
	make a meaningful impact and contribute to exciting projects as a web
	developer.

<p>
	On a personal note, I have been happily married to my wife for 16 years.
	Together, we have five wonderful children who keep our lives vibrant and full
	of joy. As a family, we love going on adventures, whether itâ€™s exploring new
	places, playing video games, going fishing, or hunting. We also enjoy hiking,
	watching movies, and spending quality time together in the great outdoors.<br />
	In my free time, when I manage to find a minute or two, I am passionate about
	learning new things that enhance my web development and programming skills. I
	believe in continuous improvement and enjoy staying updated with the latest
	technologies and trends in the industry. Additionally, I cherish moments spent
	in the woods on a cool fall morning, finding peace and inspiration in nature.
